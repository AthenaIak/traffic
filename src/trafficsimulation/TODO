- calculate desired position:
    new desired position = prev_pos + speed + max_acc
    then loop through: speed + max_acc to speed - max_dec:
        possible = ((next_car_pos + next_car_speed - max_dec) - (gap - desired_pos + speed + max_acc)) >= 0
            where gap = (floor((new_speed+max_acc) / max_dec + 1)
                where new_speed = desired_position - position
        if possible:
            return desired_pos
        else:
            check different lane at same position - incorporate position/speed of previous car on other lane:
                possible = prev_car_position + speed + max_acc + gap - position <= 0 (?)

    return impossible (?)

- calculate and update speed, lane, position based on desired position
